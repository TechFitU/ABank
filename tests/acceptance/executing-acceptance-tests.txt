1. Tagging Scenarios
@mytag
Scenario: Retrieve some other account
    ....

2. Run every acceptance tests except tagged
behave --tags=-mytags tests/acceptance

3. Run only tagged acceptance tests
behave --tags=mytags tests/acceptance

4. Unless you want to see the entire status of your test suite, you can set Lettuce
to stop execution of your tests when it encounters its first failing test.
This can also be useful locally on your development machine, where you can fail your build sooner and have a
quicker feedback loop to alert you to the need for additional changes.


behave --stop tests/acceptance
